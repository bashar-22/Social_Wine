# Abstract
* The application that has been developed is called “Social Wine”. The goal is to create a social
network focused on wine, once registered the user can explore the circulating wines, leave a
comment for each wine, like the comments of other users, and follow their friends so as not to miss
future reviews.
* Among the users, there are some admins who can make statistics on the social network and also have
the task of moderator, in fact, they can delete comments and wines and ban users. Moreover, an
admin has the possibility to elect another social wine user as an admin.
* The social network also has recommendation functions both to recommend friendships and to
recommend a wine to each user based on their interactions, this mechanism can be used for
advertising on the social network.
* Another important feature of the project is a scraper that works continuously in the background
and updates the database, to ensure that the data is always up to date with the most recent reviews
that are in Winemag.
